<br/>

I'm a data professional with a background in business and marketing analytics. I bring a strong mix of experience from the quantitative (business analytics, finance, modeling) to the creative (photography, writing, design, marketing strategy). I am particularly passionate about communicating data and insights in a way that is accessible to non-technical audiences and drives business impact. My work has ranged across roles in research, campaign strategy, and customer analytics for companies ranging from Global Fortune 50 to startups.
