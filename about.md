I'm a data science professional by way of a business and marketing analytics. My background ranges from the quantitative (business analytics, finance, machine learning) to the creative (photography, writing, design, marketing strategy). I am particularly passionate about communicating data and insights in a way that is accessible to non-technical audiences and drives business impact. Because of my background, my primary interest in data and advanced analytics is rooted in answering the critical business challenges we all face regardless of industry: getting more return on our investments, retaining more customers, improving conversion rates, driving increased value through customer experience, designing experiments that get beyond the "what" to the "how" and "why", etc.<br/>

My work has ranged across roles in market research, campaign strategy, experimental design, and customer analytics for companies ranging from Global Fortune 50 to startups.
